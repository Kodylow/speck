## Abstract

This document specifies a format for the export of labels that may be
attached to various common types of records in a wallet.

## Copyright

This BIP is licensed under the BSD 2-clause license.

## Motivation

The export and import of funds across different Bitcoin wallet
applications is well defined through standards such as BIP39, BIP32,
BIP44 etc. These standards are well supported and allow users to move
easily between different wallets. There is, however, no defined standard
to transfer any labels the user may have applied to the transactions,
addresses, public keys, inputs, outputs or xpubs in their wallet. The
UTXO model that Bitcoin uses makes these labels particularly valuable as
they may indicate the source of funds, whether received externally or as
a result of change from a prior transaction. In both cases, care must be
taken when spending to avoid undesirable leaks of private information.
Labels provide valuable guidance in this regard, and have even become
mandatory when spending in several Bitcoin wallets. Allowing users to
import and export their labels in a standardized way ensures that they
do not experience lock-in to a particular wallet application.

## Rationale

While there is currently no widely accepted format for exporting and
importing labels, there are existing formats in use. SLIP-0015[^1]
defines a format for exporting address and output labels, but requires
encryption using a private key associated with the wallet seed, and thus
cannot be used independently by coordinator wallets which cannot access
private keys. The Electrum wallet imports and exports address and
transaction labels in a JSON format which could be used with other
record types, but the format used is not self describing making record
type identification difficult.

## Specification

In order to be lightweight, human readable and well structured, this BIP
uses a JSON format. Further, the JSON Lines format is used (also called
newline-delimited JSON)[^2]. This allows a document to be split,
streamed, or incrementally added to, and limits the potential for
formatting errors to invalidate an entire import. It is also a
convenient format for command-line processing, which is often
line-oriented.

Further to the JSON Lines specification, an export of labels from a
wallet must be a UTF-8 encoded text file, containing one record per line
consisting of a valid JSON object. Lines are separated by `\n`.
Multiline values are not permitted. Each JSON object must contain 3
key/value pairs, defined as follows:

Key       Description
--------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`type`    One of `tx`, `addr`, `pubkey`, `input`, `output` or `xpub`
`ref`     Reference to the transaction, address, public key, input, output or extended public key
`label`   The label applied to the reference

The reference is defined for each `type` as follows:

Type       Description                                            Example
---------- ------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------
`tx`       Transaction id in hexadecimal format                   `f91d0a8a78462bc59398f2c5d7a84fcff491c26ba54c4833478b202796c8aafd`
`addr`     Address in base58 or bech32 format                     `bc1q34aq5drpuwy3wgl9lhup9892qp6svr8ldzyy7c`
`pubkey`   32, 33 or 65 byte public key in hexadecimal format     `0283409659355b6d1cc3c32decd5d561abaac86c37a353b52895a5e6c196d6f448`
`input`    Transaction id and input index separated by a colon    `f91d0a8a78462bc59398f2c5d7a84fcff491c26ba54c4833478b202796c8aafd:0`
`output`   Transaction id and output index separated by a colon   `f91d0a8a78462bc59398f2c5d7a84fcff491c26ba54c4833478b202796c8aafd:1`
`xpub`     Extended public key as defined by BIP32                `xpub661MyMwAqRbcFtXgS5sYJABqqG9YLmC4Q1Rdap9gSE8Nq...`

Care should be taken when exporting due to the privacy sensitive nature
of the data. Encryption in transit over untrusted networks is highly
recommended, and encryption at rest should also be considered.
Unencrypted exports should be deleted as soon as possible. For security
reasons no private key types are defined.

## Importing

-   An importing wallet may ignore records it does not store, and
truncate labels if necessary.
-   Wallets importing public key records may derive addresses from them
to match against known wallet addresses.
-   Wallets importing extended public keys may match them against
signers, for example in a multisig setup.

## Backwards Compatibility {#backwards_compatibility}

The nature of this format makes it naturally extensible to handle other
record types. However, importing wallets complying to this specification
may ignore types not defined here.

## Test Vectors {#test_vectors}

The following fragment represents a wallet label export:

{ "type": "tx", "ref": "f91d0a8a78462bc59398f2c5d7a84fcff491c26ba54c4833478b202796c8aafd", "label": "Transaction" }
{ "type": "addr", "ref": "bc1q34aq5drpuwy3wgl9lhup9892qp6svr8ldzyy7c", "label": "Address" }
{ "type": "pubkey", "ref": "0283409659355b6d1cc3c32decd5d561abaac86c37a353b52895a5e6c196d6f448", "label": "Public Key" }
{ "type": "input", "ref": "f91d0a8a78462bc59398f2c5d7a84fcff491c26ba54c4833478b202796c8aafd:0", "label": "Input" }
{ "type": "output", "ref": "f91d0a8a78462bc59398f2c5d7a84fcff491c26ba54c4833478b202796c8aafd:1", "label": "Output" }
{ "type": "xpub", "ref": "xpub661MyMwAqRbcFtXgS5sYJABqqG9YLmC4Q1Rdap9gSE8NqtwybGhePY2gZ29ESFjqJoCu1Rupje8YtGqsefD265TMg7usUDFdp6W1EGMcet8", "label": "Extended Public Key" }
