## Abstract

This BIP makes it possible for two parties to transact using addresses
that only they can calculate. This is done using exclusively on-chain
methods and in a manner that minimizes blockchain footprint. Receiving
parties can share their payment codes publicly without a loss of
privacy, as every sender will calculate a unique set of addresses for
each payment code.

## Motivation

A recipient that wishes to receive funds privately has several options.
Each has tradeoffs in terms of chain analysis potential, recoverability,
and wallet complexity.

**Sharing a static address** works well enough for one-time payments
between two parties as long as the address is shared through a private
channel. It does not work well for recurring payments because address
reuse leads to a loss of privacy. Using this method for donations
exacerbates the problem since the address will serve as a focal point
for data collection and analysis. Wallets must not reissue the same
address to multiple recipients.

**Sharing a BIP32 extended public key** works for recurring payments
between two parties only. The same key cannot be shared to any other
party without leaking the chain of payments. Furthermore, an extended
public key does not say anything about address types and makes it
possible for a sender to send to a script that a recipient cannot spend
from. Alternate [version
bytes](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0132.md)
have been proposed to specify address types, but wallet adoption is
limited.

**Sharing a BIP380 descriptor containing an extended public key** solves
the address type issue from sharing a raw BIP32 extended key. The
drawback is that descriptor support is not widespread, especially in
mobile wallets.

**Using a payment server** works in the case of recipients that have the
resources to set up and maintain a payment server that will generate a
fresh address for each payment. These are usually businesses and the
method is usually out of reach for the average user. The centralized
server is vulnerable to takedown remotely and physically.

**Sharing a BIP47 payment code** addresses most of the above
shortcomings. However, it introduces the following problems:

-   The BIP uses a notification mechanism that relies on publicly known
per-recipient notification addresses. If Alice wants to send funds
to Bob, she has to use the same notification address that everyone
else uses to notify Bob. If Alice is not careful with coin
selection, i.e. ensuring that her notification UTXO is not linked to
her, she will publicly expose herself as someone who is trying to
send funds to Bob and their relationship becomes permanently visible
on the blockchain.

```
-   The BIP does not say anything about address types. Receiving wallets
therefore have to watch all address types that can be created from a
single public key. Even then, a sender could send to a script that a
receipient cannot spend from.

## Method

When Alice wants to start paying Bob in private, she imports his payment
code into a compatible wallet. Her wallet extracts Bob\'s public key
from the payment code and sends a notification transaction. If Bob finds
a notification transaction addressed to himself, he imports Alice\'s
public key contained therein and stores it. Bob then performs ECDH using
Alice\'s public key and his own private key in order to calculate a
common set of addresses to watch. Alice calculates the same set of
addresses on her end and uses them to send coins to Bob. If Alice
engages in coin control, both the initial notification transaction and
subsequent payment transactions cannot be attributed to either party.
Even if Alice uses coins that are already associated with her, chain
analysis will identify her as a sender but Bob\'s privacy will remain
entirely preserved.

## Specification

### Definitions

-   Alice: sender
-   Bob: recipient
-   Payment code: static string that Bob generates and shares with
others so that he can receive payments
-   *P*: public key contained in Bob\'s payment code
-   *p*: private key associated with Bob\'s public key *P*
-   *N*: extended public key used by Alice to derive child keys for each
Bob she wants to transact with
-   *n*: private key associated with Alice\'s public key *N*
-   *x*: Alice\'s secret recipient index, unique for each Bob
-   *N~x~*: child public key derived from *N* at index *x*
(non-hardened)
-   *n~x~*: private key associated with *N~x~*
-   *c*: Alice\'s transaction count toward Bob
-   *P~c~*: Bob\'s public key at index *c*
-   *p~c~*: Bob\'s private key at index *c*
-   *A~c~*: Bob\'s receive address at index *c*
-   *H*: SHA256 hash function
-   *\**: EC multiplication
-   *+*: EC addition
-   *\|*: string concatenation
-   *\[a..b\]*: string slicing (inclusive of *a*, exclusive of *b*)

### Public Key Derivation Path {#public_key_derivation_path}

The derivation path for this BIP follows BIP44. The following BIP32 path
levels are defined:

`m / purpose' / coin_type' / account'`

`purpose` is set to 351.

*(p, P)* and *(n, N)* are keys associated with the above path, depending
on which side is performing the calculation.

*N~x~* keys are the direct non-hardened children of *N*. For instance,
the path of *N~0~* from *N* is *m / 0*.

### Payment Code Structure and Encoding {#payment_code_structure_and_encoding}

-   bytes `[0..2]`: address type flags (2 bytes)
-   bytes `[2..35]`: compressed public key P (33 bytes)

Payment codes are encoded in bech32m and the human readable part is
\"pay\" for mainnet and \"payt\" for testnet (all types), resulting in
payment codes that look like
\"pay1cqqq8d29g0a7m8ghmycqk5yv24mfh3xg8ptzqcn8xz6d2tjl8ccdnfkpjl7p84\".

### Address Types {#address_types}

Address type flags determine which address types a payment code accepts.
This is represented by big-endian ordered 16 bits. For instance, a
hypothetical payment code that handles all address types will have all
defined bits set to 1 (`0xffff`).

Currently defined flags:

Address Type   Flag       Flag Value   Ordinal Value
-------------- ---------- ------------ ---------------
P2PKH          `1 << 0`   `0x0001`     0
P2WPKH         `1 << 1`   `0x0002`     1
P2TR           `1 << 2`   `0x0004`     2

The remaining flags are reserved for future address types.

While payment codes use 2-byte bitflag arrays, notifications use ordinal
values in the form of a single byte.

All keys are compressed. Using uncompressed keys at any point is
illegal.

### Notifications

Notifications are performed by publishing transactions that contain a
40-byte `OP_RETURN` output. The value of the `OP_RETURN` is constructed
using the following formula:

*search_key \| notification_code \| N~x~ \| address_type*

-   *search_key* equals \"PP\" and is a static ASCII-encoded string (2
bytes)
-   *notification_code* is *H(n~x~ \* P)\[0..4\]* (4 bytes)
-   *N~x~* is the unique public key a sender is using for a particular
recipient (33 bytes)
-   *address_type* is the **ordinal** value of a single address type
that a sender wants to send to (1 byte). This must be selected from
the recepient\'s accepted address types.

When Alice wants to notify Bob that he will receive future payments from
her, she performs the following procedure:

1.  Assigns an unused, unique index *x* to Bob (*0* if Bob is the first
party she is notifying).
2.  Calculates a 4-byte notification code: *notification_code = H(n~x~
\* P)\[0..4\]*
3.  Commits to one of Bob\'s accepted address types by choosing its
ordinal value. Going forward Alice must not send to address types
other than the one she committed to in the notification.
4.  Constructs a notification payload by concatenating the above values
according to the formula.
5.  Selects any UTXO in her wallet, preferably not associated with her.
6.  Sends a transaction including an `OP_RETURN` output whose value is
set to the constructed payload.

When Bob notices a 40-byte `OP_RETURN` starting with *search key*, he
performs the following procedure:

1.  Breaks down the payload into its four constituent parts.
2.  Discards the *search_key* (item #0).
3.  Selects *N~x~* (item #2) and performs *H(N~x~ \* p)* (Bob does not
know the value of *x*). Bob takes the first four bytes of the
calculated value.
4.  If the four bytes match the notification value (item #1), Bob found
a notification addressed to himself and stores *N~x~* together with
*address_type*.
5.  If this process fails for any reason, Bob assumes a spurious
notification or one not addressed to himself and gives up.

Since changing *x* yields a completely different sender identity, Alice
can always re-notify Bob from a different index when she does not want
to be associated with her previous identity. Alice can also re-notify
Bob when she wants to start sending to a different address type. Bob
must be able to update his watchlist in that case and he can stop
watching addresses associated with the old address type.

Out-of-band notifications between Alice and Bob are legal (in fact, they
may not be prevented), but in that case Bob loses the ability to restore
his wallet from `OP_RETURN` outputs embedded in the blockchain. In that
case, Bob has the burden of keeping a valid backup of any out-of-band
notifications.

### Allowing Notification Collisions {#allowing_notification_collisions}

Since *notification_code* is a 4-byte truncation of the full value, Bob
has a 1 in \~4.3 billion chance of detecting a spurious notification.
This is considered acceptable because the cost of doing so is adding a
few more addresses to Bob\'s watchlist. The benefit of this approach is
that is saves 28 bytes per notification.

### Scanning Requirement {#scanning_requirement}

There is a scanning requirement on the recipient side in that the
recipient must have access to full blocks in order to be able to search
them for OP_RETURN outputs containing notifications. For more
information on how light clients can get around this limitation and
still use the standard, see Appendix B.

Recipients that do not want to decode raw block data can quickly search
for notifications in a block by looking for the following byte array:
`[106, 40, 80, 80]`. The first two bytes represent *OP_RETURN* and
*OP_PUSHBYTES_40*, followed by the ASCII value of *search_key*.

### Transacting

Alice initializes counter *c* which is unique to Bob and increments with
each transaction. *c* is a 64-bit integer and must be inputted into a
hasher as a big-endian encoded array of 8 bytes.

1\. Alice calculates a secret point (constant between Alice and Bob):

*S = n~x~ \* P*

2\. Alice calculates a shared secret:

*s = H(S \| c)*

3\. Alice calculates Bob\'s ephemeral public key and its associated
address where the funds will be sent:

*P~c~ = P + s\*G*

4\. Alice constructs an address using the key *P~c~*, using one of the
address types she committed to in the notification transaction.

Bob constructs his watchlist by mirroring this process on his end,
except that his method of calculating *S* is:

*S = N~x~ \* p*

When Bob wants to spend from such addresses, he calculates his private
keys in the following manner:

*p~c~ = p + s*

## Backward Compatibility {#backward_compatibility}

Private Payments is a new standard which is not compatible with any
previous standard based on static payment codes, such as BIP47.

While the standard does not support versioning, it reserves unused bits
in the address type bitflag array which can be allocated to new address
types once they are deemed ubiquitous. Older payment codes (i.e. those
generated when fewer address types were available) are readable by
software supporting new address types. The reverse is also supported
since older software will ignore newer address type flags that are not
understood.

## Appendix B: Potential OP_RETURN Services {#appendix_b_potential_op_return_services}

Compact Block Filters, as formulated in BIP-0158, do not cover
`OP_RETURN` data payloads. In support of light wallets, an external
service could publish transaction proofs for all transactions that
include the tagged notification payload. Light wallets would download
all such transactions, filter for matches against their payment code,
then verify the transaction proofs against the block headers obtained
over the P2P network.

## Appendix C: Potential Notification Transaction Services {#appendix_c_potential_notification_transaction_services}

No specific instruction is given as to the details of the notification
transaction beyond simply including the single `OP_RETURN` payload.
Since no restriction exists for other inputs or outputs of this
transaction, there is an opportunity for an external service to include
this payload in a transaction completely unrelated to Alice\'s wallet.
Such a service could charge a fee out-of-band to help cover fees.

Another opportunity exists for an existing business to attach
notification payloads to transactions sent during the normal course of
operations. Large withdrawal transactions from mining pools or exchanges
could include a marginal notification payload without affecting overall
fees.
