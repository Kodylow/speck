## Abstract

Output Script Descriptors are a simple language which can be used to
describe collections of output scripts. There can be many different
descriptor fragments and functions. This document describes the general
syntax for descriptors, descriptor checksums, and common expressions.

## Motivation

Bitcoin wallets traditionally have stored a set of keys which are later
serialized and mutated to produce the output scripts that the wallet
watches and the addresses it provides to users. Typically backups have
consisted of solely the private keys, nowadays primarily in the form of
BIP 39 mnemonics. However this backup solution is insuffient, especially
since the introduction of Segregated Witness which added new output
types. Given just the private keys, it is not possible for restored
wallets to know which kinds of output scripts and addresses to produce.
This has lead to incompatibilities between wallets when restoring a
backup or exporting data for a watch only wallet.

Further complicating matters are BIP 32 derivation paths. Although BIPs
44, 49, and 84 have specified standard BIP 32 derivation paths for
different output scripts and addresses, not all wallets support them nor
use those derivation paths. The lack of derivation path information in
these backups and exports leads to further incompatibilities between
wallets.

Current solutions to these issues have not been generic and can be
viewed as being layer violations. Solutions such as introducing
different version bytes for extended key serialization both are a layer
violation (key derivation should be separate from script type meaning)
and specific only to a particular derivation path and script type.

Output Script Descriptors introduces a generic solution to these issues.
Script types are specified explicitly through the use of Script
Expressions. Key derivation paths are specified explicitly in Key
Expressions. These allow for creating wallet backups and exports which
specify the exact scripts, subscripts (redeemScript, witnessScript,
etc.), and keys to produce. With the general structure specified in this
BIP, new Script Expressions can be introduced as new script types are
added. Lastly, the use of common terminology and existing standards
allow for Output Script Descriptors to be engineer readable so that the
results can be understood at a glance.

## Specification

Descriptors consist of several types of expressions. The top level
expression is a `SCRIPT`. This expression may be followed by
`#CHECKSUM`, where `CHECKSUM` is an 8 character alphanumeric descriptor
checksum. Although the checksum is optional for parsing, applications
may choose to reject descriptors that do not contain a checksum.

### Script Expressions {#script_expressions}

Script Expressions (denoted `SCRIPT`) are expressions which correspond
directly with a Bitcoin script. These expressions are written as
functions and take arguments. Such expressions have a script template
which is filled with the arguments correspondingly. Expressions are
written with a human readable identifier string with the arguments
enclosed with parentheses. The identifier string should be alphanumeric
and may include underscores.

The arguments to a script expression are defined by that expression
itself. They could be a script expression, a key expression, or some
other expression entirely.

### Key Expressions {#key_expressions}

A common expression used as an argument to script expressions are key
expressions (denoted `KEY`). These represent a public or private key
and, optionally, information about the origin of that key. Key
expressions can only be used as arguments to script expressions.

Key expressions consist of:

-   Optionally, key origin information, consisting of:
-   An open bracket `[`
-   Exactly 8 hex characters for the fingerprint of the key where
the derivation starts (see BIP 32 for details)
-   Followed by zero or more `/NUM` or `/NUMh` path elements to
indicate the unhardened or hardened derivation steps between the
fingerprint and the key that follows.
-   A closing bracket `]`
-   Followed by the actual key, which is either:
-   A hex encoded public key, which depending the script expression,
may be either:
-   66 hex character string beginning with `02` or `03`
representing a compressed public key
-   130 hex character string beginning with `04` representing an
uncompressed public key
-   A
[WIF](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format "wikilink")
encoded private key
-   `xpub` encoded extended public key or `xprv` encoded extended
private key (as defined in BIP 32)
-   Followed by zero or more `/NUM` or `/NUMh` path elements
indicating BIP 32 derivation steps to be taken after the
given extended key.
-   Optionally followed by a single `/*` or `/*h` final step to
denote all direct unhardened or hardened children.

If the `KEY` is a BIP 32 extended key, before output scripts can be
created, child keys must be derived using the derivation information
that follows the extended key. When the final step is `/*` or `/*'`, an
output script will be produced for every child key index. The derived
key must be not be serialized as an uncompressed public key. Script
Expressions may have further requirements on how derived public keys are
serialized for script creation.

In the above specification, the hardened indicator `h` may be replaced
with alternative hardened indicators of `H` or `'`.

#### Normalization of Key Expressions with Hardened Derivation {#normalization_of_key_expressions_with_hardened_derivation}

When a descriptor is exported without private keys, it is necessary to
do additional derivation to remove any intermediate hardened derivation
steps for the exported descriptor to be useful. The exporter should
derive the extended public key at the last hardened derivation step and
use that extended public key as the key in the descriptor. The
derivation steps that were taken to get to that key must be added to the
previous key origin information. If there is no key origin information,
then one must be added for the newly derived extended public key. If the
final derivation is hardened, then it is not necessary to do additional
derivation.

### Character Set {#character_set}

The expressions used in descriptors must only contain characters within
this character set so that the descriptor checksum will work.

The allowed characters are:

0123456789()[],'/*abcdefgh@:$%{}
IJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&+-.;<=>?!^_|~
ijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGH`#"\<space>

Note that `<space>`{=html} on the last line is a space character.

This character set is written as 3 groups of 32 characters in this
specific order so that the checksum below can identify more errors. The
first group are the most common \"unprotected\" characters (i.e. things
such as hex and keypaths that do not already have their own checksums).
Case errors cause an offset that is a multiple of 32 while as many
alphabetic characters are in the same group while following the previous
restrictions.

### Checksum

Following the top level script expression is a single octothorpe (`#`)
followed by the 8 character checksum. The checksum is an error
correcting checksum similar to bech32.

The checksum has the following properties:

-   Mistakes in a descriptor string are measured in \"symbol errors\".
The higher the number of symbol errors, the harder it is to detect:
-   An error substituting a character from
`0123456789()[],'/*abcdefgh@:$%{}` for another in that set
always counts as 1 symbol error.
-   Note that hex encoded keys are covered by these characters.
Extended keys (`xpub` and `xprv`) use other characters too,
but also have their own checksum mechanism.
-   `SCRIPT` expression function names use other characters, but
mistakes in these would generally result in an unparsable
descriptor.
-   A case error always counts as 1 symbol error.
-   Any other 1 character substitution error counts as 1 or 2 symbol
errors.
-   Any 1 symbol error is always detected.
-   Any 2 or 3 symbol error in a descriptor of up to 49154 characters is
always detected.
-   Any 4 symbol error in a descriptor of up to 507 characters is always
detected.
-   Any 5 symbol error in a descriptor of up to 77 characters is always
detected.
-   Is optimized to minimize the chance of a 5 symbol error in a
descriptor up to 387 characters is undetected
-   Random errors have a chance of 1 in
2`<super>`{=html}40`</super>`{=html} of being undetected.

The checksum itself uses the same character set as bech32:
`qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l`

Valid descriptor strings with a checksum must pass the criteria for
validity specified by the Python3 code snippet below. The function
`descsum_check` must return true when its argument `s` is a descriptor
consisting in the form `SCRIPT#CHECKSUM`.

INPUT_CHARSET = "0123456789()[],'/*abcdefgh@:$%{}IJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&+-.;<=>?!^_|~ijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGH`#\"\\ "
CHECKSUM_CHARSET = "qpzry9x8gf2tvdw0s3jn54khce6mua7l"
GENERATOR = [0xf5dee51989, 0xa9fdca3312, 0x1bab10e32d, 0x3706b1677a, 0x644d626ffd]

def descsum_polymod(symbols):
"""Internal function that computes the descriptor checksum."""
chk = 1
for value in symbols:
top = chk >> 35
chk = (chk & 0x7ffffffff) << 5 ^ value
for i in range(5):
chk ^= GENERATOR[i] if ((top >> i) & 1) else 0
return chk

def descsum_expand(s):
"""Internal function that does the character to symbol expansion"""
groups = []
symbols = []
for c in s:
if not c in INPUT_CHARSET:
return None
v = INPUT_CHARSET.find(c)
symbols.append(v & 31)
groups.append(v >> 5)
if len(groups) == 3:
symbols.append(groups[0] * 9 + groups[1] * 3 + groups[2])
groups = []
if len(groups) == 1:
symbols.append(groups[0])
elif len(groups) == 2:
symbols.append(groups[0] * 3 + groups[1])
return symbols

def descsum_check(s):
"""Verify that the checksum is correct in a descriptor"""
if s[-9] != '#':
return False
if not all(x in CHECKSUM_CHARSET for x in s[-8:]):
return False
symbols = descsum_expand(s[:-9]) + [CHECKSUM_CHARSET.find(x) for x in s[-8:]]
return descsum_polymod(symbols) == 1

This implements a BCH code that has the properties described above. The
entire descriptor string is first processed into an array of symbols.
The symbol for each character is its position within its group. After
every 3rd symbol, a 4th symbol is inserted which represents the group
numbers combined together. This means that a change that only affects
the position within a group, or only a group number change, will only
affect a single symbol.

To construct a valid checksum given a script expression, the code below
can be used:

def descsum_create(s):
"""Add a checksum to a descriptor without"""
symbols = descsum_expand(s) + [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
checksum = descsum_polymod(symbols) ^ 1
return s + '#' + ''.join(CHECKSUM_CHARSET[(checksum >> (5 * (7 - i))) & 31] for i in range(8))

## Backwards Compatibility {#backwards_compatibility}

Output script descriptors are an entirely new language which is not
compatible with any existing software. However many components of the
expressions reuse encodings and serializations defined by previous BIPs.

Output script descriptors are designed for future extension with further
fragment types and new script expressions. These will be specified in
additional BIPs.

## Reference Implementation {#reference_implementation}

Descriptors have been implemented in Bitcoin Core since version 0.17.
