## Abstract

This document specifies `combo()` output script descriptors. These take
a key and produce P2PK, P2PKH, P2WPKH, and P2SH-P2WPKH output scripts if
applicable to the key.

## Motivation

In order to make the transition from traditional key based wallets to
descriptor based wallets easier, it is useful to be able to take a key
and produce the scripts which have traditionally been produced by wallet
software.

## Specification

A new top level script expression is defined: `combo(KEY)`. This
expression can only be used as a top level expression. It takes a single
key expression as an argument and produces either 2 or 4 output scripts,
depending on the key. A `combo()` expression always produces a P2PK and
P2PKH script, the same as putting the key in both a `pk()` and a `pkh()`
expression. If the key is/has a compressed public key, then P2WPKH and
P2SH-P2WPKH scripts are also produced, the same as putting the key in
both a `wpkh()` and `sh(wpkh())` expression.

## Test Vectors {#test_vectors}

TBD

## Backwards Compatibility {#backwards_compatibility}

`combo()` descriptors use the format and general operation specified in
[380](bip-0380.mediawiki "wikilink"). As this is a wholly new
descriptor, it is not compatible with any implementation. However the
scripts produced are standard scripts so existing software are likely to
be familiar with them.

## Reference Implementation {#reference_implementation}

`combo()` descriptors have been implemented in Bitcoin Core since
version 0.17.
