## Introduction

### Abstract

This BIP describes a new type of public key for tapscript ([BIP
342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink")) transactions. It allows signatures
for these public keys to not commit to the exact UTXO being spent. This
enables dynamic binding of transactions to different UTXOs, provided
they have compatible scripts.

### Motivation

Off-chain protocols make use of transactions that are not yet broadcast
to the Bitcoin network in order to renegotiate the final state that
should be settled on-chain. In a number of cases it is desirable to
respond to a given transaction being seen on-chain with a predetermined
reaction in the form of another transaction. Often the same reaction is
desired for a variety of different transactions that may be seen
on-chain, but because the input signatures in the response transaction
commit to the exact transaction that is being reacted to, this means a
new signature must be created for every possible transaction one wishes
to be able to react to.

This proposal introduces a new public key type[^1] that modifies the
behavior of the transaction digest algorithm used in the signature
creation and verification, by excluding the commitment to the previous
output (and, optionally, the witness script[^2] and value [^3]).
Removing this commitment allows dynamic rebinding of a signed
transaction to another previous output that requires authorisation by
the same key.

The dynamic rebinding is opt-in due to using a separate public key type,
and the breadth of transactions the signature can be rebound to can be
further restricted by using different keys, committing to the script
being spent in the signature, using different amounts between UTXOs,
using different nSequence values in the spending transaction, or using
the codeseparator opcode to commit to the position in the script.

## Specification

This BIP modifies the behaviour of the [BIP
342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink") signature opcodes[^4] (`CHECKSIG`,
`CHECKSIGVERIFY`, and `CHECKSIGADD`) for public keys that have a length
of 33 bytes and a first byte of `0x01` or the public key which is
precisely the single byte vector `0x01`[^5]. These keys are termed **BIP
118 public keys**.

#### Rules for signature opcodes {#rules_for_signature_opcodes}

The [BIP 342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink") rules for signature opcodes
are modified by removing keys with the first byte `0x01` and length of
either 1-byte or 33-bytes from the list of unknown public key types, and
adding the following rule prior to the handling of unknown public key
types:

-   If the public key is the single byte `0x01`, or if the public key is
33 bytes and the first byte of the public key is `0x01`, it is
considered to be a BIP 118 public key:
-   If the signature is not the empty vector, the signature is
validated according to the [BIP
341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink") signing validation rules
with the public key, allowable `hash_type` values, and
transaction digest modified as defined below.

#### Public key {#public_key}

To convert the 1-byte BIP 118 public key for use with [BIP
340](bip-0340.mediawiki "wikilink"), use the 32-byte taproot internal
key, `p`, as defined in [BIP 341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink").

To convert a 33-byte BIP 118 public key for use with [BIP
340](bip-0340.mediawiki "wikilink"), remove the `0x01` prefix and use
the remaining 32 bytes.

#### Signature message {#signature_message}

We define the functions *Msg118(hash_type)* and *Ext118(hash_type)*
which compute the message being signed as a byte array.

The parameter *hash_type* is an 8-bit unsigned value, reusing values
defined in [BIP 341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink"), with the addition
that the values `0x41`, `0x42`, `0x43`, `0xc1`, `0xc2`, and `0xc3` are
also valid for BIP 118 public keys.

We define the following constants using bits 6 and 7 of `hash_type`:

-   `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT = 0x40`
-   `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT = 0xc0`

The following restrictions apply and cause validation failure if
violated:

-   Using any undefined *hash_type* (not *0x00*, *0x01*, *0x02*, *0x03*,
*0x41*, *0x42*, *0x43*, *0x81*, *0x82*, *0x83*, *0xc1*, *0xc2*, or
*0xc3*).
-   Using `SIGHASH_SINGLE` without a \"corresponding output\" (an output
with the same index as the input being verified).

If these restrictions are not violated, *Msg118(hash_type)* evaluates as
follows.

If *hash_type & 0x40 == 0*, then *Msg118(hash_type) = SigMsg(hash_type,
1)*, where *SigMsg* is as defined in [BIP
341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink").

If *hash_type & 0x40 != 0*, then *Msg118(hash_type)* is the
concatenation of the following data, in order (with byte size of each
item listed in parentheses). Numerical values in 2, 4, or 8-byte items
are encoded in little-endian.

-   Control:
-   *hash_type* (1).
-   Transaction data:
-   *nVersion* (4): the *nVersion* of the transaction.
-   *nLockTime* (4): the *nLockTime* of the transaction.
-   If *hash_type & 3* does not equal `SIGHASH_NONE` or
`SIGHASH_SINGLE`:
-   *sha_outputs* (32): the SHA256 of the serialization of all
outputs in `CTxOut` format.
-   Data about this input:
-   *spend_type* (1): equal to 2 if no annex is present, or 3
otherwise (the original witness stack has two or more witness
elements, and the first byte of the last element is *0x50*)
-   If *hash_type & 0xc0* is `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT`:
-   *amount* (8): value of the previous output spent by this
input.
-   *scriptPubKey* (35): *scriptPubKey* of the previous output
spent by this input, serialized as script inside `CTxOut`.
Its size is always 35 bytes.
-   *nSequence* (4): *nSequence* of this input.
-   If an annex is present (the lowest bit of *spend_type* is set):
-   *sha_annex* (32): the SHA256 of *(compact_size(size of
annex) \|\| annex)*, where *annex* includes the mandatory
*0x50* prefix.
-   Data about this output:
-   If *hash_type & 3* equals `SIGHASH_SINGLE`:
-   *sha_single_output* (32): the SHA256 of the corresponding
output in `CTxOut` format.

Similarly, *Ext118(hash_type)* evaluates to the concatenation of the
following data, in order:

-   Extension:
-   If *hash_type & 0xc0* is not `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT`:
-   *tapleaf_hash* (32): the tapleaf hash as defined in [BIP
341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink")
-   *key_version* (1): a constant value *0x01* representing that
this is a signature for a BIP 118 public key.
-   *codesep_pos* (4): the opcode position of the last executed
`OP_CODESEPARATOR` before the currently executed signature
opcode, with the value in little endian (or *0xffffffff* if none
executed). The first opcode in a script has a position of 0. A
multi-byte push opcode is counted as one opcode, regardless of
the size of data being pushed.

To verify a signature *sig* for a BIP 118 public key *p*:

-   If the *sig* is 64 bytes long, return *Verify(p,
hash~TapSigHash~(0x00 \|\| Msg118(0x00) \|\| Ext118(0x00)), sig)*
-   If the *sig* is 65 bytes long, return *sig\[64\] â‰  0x00 and
Verify(p, hash~TapSighash~(0x00 \|\| Msg118(sig\[64\]) \|\|
Ext118(sig\[64\])), sig\[0:64\])*.
-   Otherwise, fail.

*Verify* is as defined in [BIP 340](bip-0340.mediawiki "wikilink").

The key differences from [BIP 342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink")
signature verification are:

-   In all cases, `key_version` is set to the constant value `0x01`
instead of `0x00`.[^6]
-   If `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` is set, the digest is calculated as if
`SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` was set, except `outpoint` is not included in
the digest.
-   If `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT` is set, the digest is calculated as
if `SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` was set, except `outpoint`, `amount`,
`scriptPubKey` and `tapleaf_hash` are not included in the digest.

## Security

#### Signature replay {#signature_replay}

By design, `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` and `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT`
introduce additional potential for signature replay (that is they allow
the same signature to be reused on a different transaction) when
compared to `SIGHASH_ALL` and `SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` signatures.

Both `SIGHASH_ALL` and `SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` signatures prevent
signature replay by committing to one or more inputs, so replay of the
signature is only possible if the same input can be spent multiple
times, which is not possible on the Bitcoin blockchain (due to
enforcement of [BIP 30](bip-0030.mediawiki "wikilink")). With
`SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` signature replay is possible for different UTXOs
with the same `scriptPubKey` and the same value, while with
`SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT` signature replay is possible for any UTXOs
that reuse the same BIP 118 public key in one of their potential
scripts.

As a consequence, implementors MUST ensure that BIP 118 public keys are
only reused when signature replay cannot cause loss of funds (eg due to
other features of the protocol or other constraints on the transaction),
or when such a loss of funds is acceptable.

#### Malleability

Use of `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` or `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT` may
introduce additional malleability vectors.

In particular, a transaction authenticated using only ANYPREVOUT
signatures is malleable to anyone able to provide an alternate input
satisfied by the signature \-- an input changed in this way would
produce a new, valid transaction paying the same recipient, but with a
different txid. Depending on the changes to the inputs, this might
conflict with the original transaction (if some inputs remain shared) or
might result in a double-payment to the recipient (if they do not).

Further, for a chain of transactions using the same `scriptPubKey` and
value, and only authenticated via ANYPREVOUT signatures (as envisioned
in eltoo for failure cases), it may be possible for any third party to
malleate the transactions (and their txids) without having access to any
of the private keys, particularly by omitting intermediate transactions.

This form of malleation can be dealt with by the child transactions also
using ANYPREVOUT signatures \-- when a parent transaction is malleated,
its children can be adjusted to reference the new txid as the input and
the ANYPREVOUT signatures remain valid.

However child transactions that are authorised by a `SIGHASH_ALL` or
`SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` signature will need new signatures if their
inputs are malleated in this way. This risk may be mitigated somewhat by
using [BIP 68](bip-0068.mediawiki "wikilink")/[BIP
112](bip-0112.mediawiki "wikilink") relative time locks before spending
a UTXO that had been authorised via an ANYPREVOUT signature with
`SIGHASH_ALL` or `SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY`: a relative timelock can ensure
that the inputs have enough confirmations that they can only be replaced
in the event of a large block reorg. Note that this approach has
drawbacks: relative timelocks prevent fee-bumping via
child-pays-for-parent, and have the obvious drawback of making the funds
temporarily unusable until the timelock expires.

#### Privacy considerations {#privacy_considerations}

It is expected that ANYPREVOUT signatures will only be rarely used in
practice. Protocol and wallet designers should aim to have their
transactions use Taproot key path spends whenever possible, both for
efficiency reasons due to the lower transaction weight, but also for
privacy reasons to avoid third parties being able to distinguish their
transactions from those of other protocols.

Transactions that do use ANYPREVOUT signatures will therefore reveal
information about the transaction, potentially including that
cooperation was impossible, or what protocol or software was used (due
to the details of the script).

In order to maximise privacy, it is therefore recommended that protocol
designers only use BIP 118 public keys in scripts that will be spent
using at least one ANYPREVOUT signature, and either use key path spends
or alternate scripts in the taproot merkle tree for any spends that can
be authorised without ANYPREVOUT signatures. Following this
recommendation may require additional script branches, which may mean
disregarding this recommendation may result in a better tradeoff between
cost and privacy in some circumstances.

## Deployment

TODO

This may be deployed as a soft-fork either concurrent with, or
subsequent to the deployment of [BIP
340](bip-0340.mediawiki "wikilink"), [BIP
341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink") and [BIP
342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink").

## Backwards compatibility {#backwards_compatibility}

As a soft fork, older software will continue to operate without
modification. Nodes that have not upgraded to support [BIP
341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink") will see all taproot witness
programs as anyone-can-spend scripts, and nodes that have upgraded to
support [BIP 341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink") and [BIP
342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink") but not BIP 118 will simply treat
any non-empty signature against a BIP 118 public key as valid. As such,
nodes are strongly encourage to upgrade in order to fully validate
signatures for the new public key type.

Non-upgraded wallets can receive and send bitcoin from non-upgraded and
upgraded wallets using SegWit version 0 programs, traditional
pay-to-pubkey-hash, etc. Depending on the implementation, non-upgraded
wallets may be able to send to SegWit version 1 programs if they support
sending to [BIP350](bip-0350.mediawiki "wikilink") Bech32m addresses and
do not prevent the transaction from being broadcast due to considering
the outputs non-standard.

## Revisions

Apart from being based on Taproot rather than SegWit v0, the main
differences to prior revisions of this BIP are:

-   The sighash flag has been renamed from \"NOINPUT\" to \"ANYPREVOUT\"
to reflect that while any prevout may potentially be used with the
signature, some aspects of the input are still committed to, namely
the input nSequence value, and (optionally) the spending conditions
and amount.
-   Previously NOINPUT would have worked for direct public key spends
(assuming deployment was fleshed out in a way similar to BIP 141
P2WPKH and P2WSH), however this proposal only applies to signatures
via tapscript, and not direct key path spends. This means that
addresses must opt-in to the ability to be spent by a
`SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` or `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT` signature by
including an appropriate tapscript path when the address is created.
-   NOINPUT signatures do not commit to the output\'s spending
conditions either via `scriptPubKey` or the redeem/witness script.
This behaviour is preserved when `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT` is
used, but when `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` is used, the signature now
commits to `scriptPubKey` and the tapscript.
-   NOINPUT signatures did commit to the input\'s amount. This behaviour
is preserved when `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` is used, but not when
`SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT` is used.
-   `OP_CODESEPARATOR` in script will affect both `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT`
and `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT` signatures, whereas it would not
have in the previous draft.

## Acknowledgements

The `SIGHASH_NOINPUT` flag was first proposed by Joseph Poon in
[February
2016](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-February/012460.html),
after being mentioned in the original [Lightning
paper](http://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) by Joseph
Poon and Thaddeus Dryja. This document is the result of discussions with
many people and had direct input from Greg Maxwell, Jonas Nick, Pieter
Wuille and others.

[^1]: **Why a new public key type?** New public key types for tapscript
can be introduced in a soft fork by specifying new rules for
*unknown public key types* as specified in [BIP
342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink"), as this only requires adding
restrictions to the pre-existing signature opcodes. Possible
alternative approaches would be to define new script opcodes, to use
a different taproot leaf version, or to use a different set of
SegWit outputs than those specified by [BIP
341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink"); however all of these approaches
are more complicated, and are better reserved for other upgrades
where the additional flexibility is actually needed. In this case,
we specify a new transaction digest, but retain the same elliptic
curve and signature algorithm (ie, secp256k1 and [BIP
340](bip-0340.mediawiki "wikilink")).

[^2]: **Why (and why not) commit to the witness script?** The
[eltoo](https://blockstream.com/eltoo.pdf) paper provides an example
of why committing to the witness script is not always appropriate.
It uses script and the transaction `nLockTime` to make signatures
asymmetric, so that a transaction with an earlier signature can be
spent by a transaction with a later signature, but a transaction
with a later signature cannot be spent by a transaction with an
earlier signature. As a result, a single signature for a third, even
later transaction must be able to spend both the prior transactions,
even though they have a different tapscript. On the other hand,
these cases also provide a good reason to have the option to commit
to the script: because each transaction has a new script, committing
to the script allows you to produce a signature that applies to
precisely one of these transactions. In the eltoo case, this allows
you to have a signature for an update transaction that can be
applied to any prior update, and a signature for a settlement
transaction that applies only to the corresponding update
transaction, while using the same key for both, which in turn allows
for a more compact script.

[^3]: **Why (and why not) commit to the input value?** Committing to the
input value may provide additional safety that a signature can\'t be
maliciously reused to claim funds that the signer does not intend to
spend, so by default it seems sensible to commit to it. However,
doing so prevents being able to use a single signature to
consolidate a group of UTXOs with the same spending condition into a
single UTXO which may be useful for some protocols, such as the
proposal for [layered commitments with
eltoo](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2020-January/002448.html).

[^4]: **What about key path spends?** This proposal only supports
ANYPREVOUT signatures via script path spends, and does not support
ANYPREVOUT signatures for key path spends. This is for two reasons:
first, not supporting key path spends allows this proposal to be
independent of the core changes included in [BIP
341](bip-0341.mediawiki "wikilink") and [BIP
342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink"); second, it allows addresses to
opt-in or opt-out of ANYPREVOUT support while remaining
indistinguishable prior to being spent.

[^5]: **Use of 0x01 public key type** Because `OP_0` leaves an empty
vector on the stack it would not satisfy [BIP
342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink")\'s rules for unknown public key
types. As such, it is convenient to use one of `OP_1..OP_16` or
`OP_1NEGATE` as a way to reference the taproot internal key. To keep
things as simple as possible, we use the first of these, and add the
same byte as a prefix to allow ANYPREVOUT signatures for explicitly
specified keys.

[^6]: **Why change key_version?** Changing `key_version` ensures that if
the same private key is used to generate both a [BIP
342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink") key and a BIP 118 public key,
that a signature for the [BIP 342](bip-0342.mediawiki "wikilink")
key is not also valid for the BIP 118 public key (and vice-versa).
