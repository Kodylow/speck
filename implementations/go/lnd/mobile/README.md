# Building mobile libraries

## Prerequisites

To build for iOS, you need to run macOS with either 
[Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=command%20line%20tools) 
or [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835) installed.

To build for Android, you need either 
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or 
[Command Line Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) installed, which in turn must be used to install [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/).


### Go and Go mobile

First, follow the instructions to [install Go](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md#building-a-development-version-from-source).

Then, install [Go mobile](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Mobile) and 
initialize it:

```shell
go install golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile@latest
go mod download golang.org/x/mobile
gomobile init
```

### Docker

Install and run [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Make

Check that `make` is available by running the following command without errors:

```shell
make --version
```

## Building the libraries

Note that `gomobile` only supports building projects from `$GOPATH` at this 
point. However, with the introduction of Go modules, the source code files are 
no longer installed there by default.

To be able to do so, we must turn off module and using the now deprecated 
`go get` command before turning modules back on again.

```shell
go env -w GO111MODULE="off"
go get github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd
go get golang.org/x/mobile/bind
go env -w GO111MODULE="on"
```

Finally, let’s change directory to the newly created lnd folder inside `$GOPATH`:

```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd
```

It is not recommended building from the master branch for mainnet. To checkout
the latest tagged release of lnd, run

```shell
git checkout $(git describe --match "v[0-9]*" --abbrev=0)
```

### iOS

```shell
make ios
```

The Xcode framework file will be found in `mobile/build/ios/Lndmobile.xcframework`.

### Android

```shell
make android
```

The AAR library file will be found in `mobile/build/android/Lndmobile.aar`.

---
Tip: `make mobile` will build both iOS and Android libraries.

## Generating proto definitions

In order to call the methods in the generated library, the serialized proto for
the given RPC call must be provided. Similarly, the response will be a
serialized proto.

### iOS

In order to generate protobuf definitions for iOS, add `--swift_out=.` to the
first `protoc` invocation found in [ `gen_protos.sh` ](../lnrpc/gen_protos.sh).

Then, some changes to [Dockerfile](../lnrpc/Dockerfile) need to be done in
order to use the [Swift protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf)
plugin with protoc:

1. Replace the base image with `FROM swift:focal` so that Swift can be used.
2. `clang-format='1:7.0*'` is unavailable in Ubuntu Focal. Change that to
`clang-format='1:10.0*'`.
3. On the next line, install Go and set the environment variables by adding the
following commands:

```
RUN apt-get install -y wget \
    && wget -c https://golang.org/dl/go1.17.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - \
    | tar -xz -C /usr/local
ENV GOPATH=/go
ENV PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:/go/bin
```

4. At the end of the file, just above `CMD`, add the following `RUN` command.
This will download and compile the latest tagged release of Swift protobuf.

```
RUN git clone https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf.git \
&& cd swift-protobuf \ 
&& git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0) \
&& swift build -c release \
&& mv .build/release/protoc-gen-swift /bin
```

Finally, run `make rpc`.

Tip: The generated Swift files will be found in various folders. If you’d like
to move them to the same folder as the framework file, run

```shell
find . -name "*.swift" -print0 | xargs -0 -I {} mv {} mobile/build/ios
```

`Lndmobile.xcframework` and all Swift files should now be added to your Xcode
project. You will also need to add [Swift Protobuf](https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf)
to your project to support the generated code.  

### Android

#### First option:

In order to generate protobuf definitions for Android, add `--java_out=.`

to the first `protoc` invocation found in
[ `gen_protos.sh` ](../lnrpc/gen_protos.sh). Then, run `make rpc`.


#### Second option (preferable):

- You have to install the profobuf plugin to your Android application. 
Please, follow this link https://github.com/google/protobuf-gradle-plugin.
- Add this line to your `app build.gradle` file.
```shell
classpath "com.google.protobuf:protobuf-gradle-plugin:0.8.17"
```
- Create a `proto` folder under the `main` folder.

![proto_folder](docs/proto_folder.png)

- Add `aar` file to libs folder.

- After that add these lines to your `module's` `build.gradle` file:

```shell
plugins {
    id "com.google.protobuf"
}

android {
    sourceSets {
        main {
            proto {

            }
        }
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: "libs", include: ["*.jar"])
    implementation "com.google.protobuf:protobuf-javalite:${rootProject.ext.javalite_version}"
}

protobuf {
    protoc {
        artifact = "com.google.protobuf:protoc:${rootProject.ext.protoc_version}"
    }
    generateProtoTasks {
        all().each { task ->
            task.builtins {
                java {
                    option "lite"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Then, copy all the proto files from `lnd/lnrpc` to your `proto` folder, saving the structure.
- Build the project and wait until you see the generated Java proto files in the `build` folder.


--- 
*Note:*

If Android Studio tells you that the `aar` file cannot be included into the `app-bundle`, this is a workaround:

1. Create a separate gradle module
2. Remove everything from there and leave only `aar` and `build.gradle`.

![separate_gradle_module](docs/separate_gradle_module.png)

3. Gradle file should contain only these lines:

```shell
configurations.maybeCreate("default")
artifacts.add("default", file('Lndmobile.aar'))
```

4. In `dependencies` add this line instead of depending on `libs` folder:
```shell
implementation project(":lndmobile", { "default" })
```

## Calling the API

In LND v0.15+ all API methods have prefixed the generated methods with the subserver name. This is required to support subservers with name conflicts.

eg. `QueryScores` is now `AutopilotQueryScores`. `GetBlockHeader` is now `NeutrinoKitGetBlockHeader`.
